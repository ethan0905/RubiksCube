# RubiksCube

developped in: Java  
tool for execution: Processing  
library used for rendering: PeasyCam  

status:  
program currently render a 3 dimensionnal rubik's cube, apply moves to it (scramble) and solve it back to initial state using reverse instructions.  
next step would be to implement machine learning, and to train the AI to solve the cube, based on pro's resolutions of the cube.
